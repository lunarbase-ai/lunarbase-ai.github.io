# Workflow Co-piloting

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to use the co-pilot feature to create and refine workflows effortlessly.

## Setup

To use the co-pilot, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain an Azure OpenAI API Key**: The co-pilot leverages a large language model (LLM) from Azure OpenAI. You will need to obtain an API key to access this service. Visit Azure OpenAIâ€™s portal to get your key.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set the required environment variables for LunarCore to use the API key. For detailed instructions on how to do this automatically at the startup of LunarCore, refer to our [Adding Your LLM API Key](add_api_key) guide.

## Using the Co-pilot

The co-pilot can assist in two ways:
- **Creating a Workflow from Scratch**: Simply provide a workflow description to the co-pilot in the Lunar home page, and the co-pilot will generate a workflow tailored to your needs.
- **Refining Existing Workflows**: The co-pilot can enhance and modify your existing workflows based on your input in the workflow editor.

Watch the video below for a detailed walkthrough of how to use the co-pilot:
