# Importing a Workflow

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to import a workflow JSON file into **Lunar**. At the end of the guide, you will find a video that demonstrates the entire process.

## Steps to Import a Workflow

### 1. Download the Workflow JSON

- **Option 1: Folder with Workflow JSON**  
  Download the folder containing the workflow JSON file.

- **Option 2: JSON File Only**  
  If you only have the JSON file, create a new folder with the same name as the JSON file, and move the file into that folder.

### 2. Open the `.env` File

- Navigate to your **LunarCore** directory and open the `.env` file using your preferred text editor. This file contains the environment variables that control various settings in LunarCore.

### 3. Locate the `FLOW_STORAGE_BASE_PATH`

- In the `.env` file, locate the environment variable `FLOW_STORAGE_BASE_PATH`. This is the path where all your workflows are stored.
  
- Navigate to this path in your file system.

### 4. Navigate to Your User Directory

- Within the `FLOW_STORAGE_BASE_PATH`, open the directory that matches your Lunar username.

- Inside this directory, open the folder named `workflows`.

### 5. Move the Workflow Folder

- Move the folder containing your workflow JSON file into the `workflows` directory you just opened.
