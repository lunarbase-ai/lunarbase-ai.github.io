# Exporting a Workflow

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to export a workflow from **Lunar**. At the end of the guide, you will find a video that demonstrates the entire process.

## Steps to Export a Workflow

### 1. Find the Workflow ID

- Open the workflow you want to export in the **Lunar** web interface.
  
- Once the workflow is open, look at the URL in your browser. The **workflow ID** is the last part of the URL. Copy or note this ID, as it will help you locate the workflow on your system.

### 2. Locate the Workflow on Your System

- Navigate to the directory where your workflows are stored. To find this location, check the `FLOW_STORAGE_BASE_PATH` environment variable in your **LunarCore** `.env` file.

- Inside this path, open the directory with your Lunar username, then go to the `workflows` folder.

### 3. Find the Workflow Folder

- In the `workflows` directory, locate the folder that corresponds to the workflow ID you found in Step 1. Each workflow is stored in its own folder, named according to the workflow ID.

### 4. Copy the Workflow Folder

- Copy the entire folder that contains the workflow JSON file and any related assets.

### 5. Export the Folder

- Move or save the copied folder to your desired location. You can now share the workflow folder, upload it to a repository, or back it up for future use.
