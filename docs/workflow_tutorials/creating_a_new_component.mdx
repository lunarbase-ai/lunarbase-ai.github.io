# Creating a new Base Component

## What is a Base Component?

Base Components are the default components. All components in the `component_library` directory will be automatically listed as Base Components and will be available to all users in your deployment.

## Creating a new Base Component

1. Create a new package
Add your component package to the `lunarverse/components` directory

2. Extend BaseComponent
Your new component must extend the `BaseComponent` class from `lunarverse.components.base` and you have to set these following mandatory arguments:

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| component_name | `str` | The name of your component |
| component_description | `str` | The decription of your component. It is important to clearly specify what your component does because this field will be used for auto workflow generation |
| input_types | a `dict` of `DataType`s | The inputs your component receive. The keys of the dictionary will be interpreted as the input labels and you can check the available data types [here](../component.md#data-types) |
| output_type | `DataType` | The output of the component |

You can also specify custom arguments in addition to the mandatory ones. These will be interpreted as component configurations.

Example:
```
class MyCustomComponent(
    BaseComponent,
    component_name="Component Name",
    component_description="Describe what the component does",
    input_types={"Custom JSON": DataType.JSON},
    output_types=DataType.JSON,
    custom_argument="Deault custom_argument value",
    ...
):
    ...
```

### The run method
When a workflow with your component runs, this is the method called. So you need to implement it.

#### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| inputs | `Union[List[ComponentInput], ComponentInput]` | Either a list of component inputs or a component input (if there's only one)

Example:
```
def run(self, inputs: ComponentInput, **kwargs: Any):
    data = dict()
    images = [self.__class__.plot_bar_chart(inputs.value)]
    data.update(inputs.value)
    return {"data": data, "images": images}
```

## Dependencies
It is possible to add python packages dependencies to your component, and in order to do that, you just have to add a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your component's package, following the classical [PIP requirements](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/). All dependencies will be installed and be available at workflow running time.

## File Connector
The FileConnector class provides an interface for file operations in a controlled environment. It allows you to create, read, list, and delete files relatively to the workflow that is executing the component. You can access a FileConnector instance through the `_file_connector` property of the component.

### Methods

#### Create file
`create_file(self, file_name: str, content: Union[AnyStr, Generator[AnyStr, None, None]])`
Creates a new file with the specified content. Raises a `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.

##### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `file_name` | str | The name of the file to be created. |
| `content` | Union[AnyStr, Generator[AnyStr, None, None]] | The content to be written to the file. |

#### Get file by name
`get_file_by_name(self, file_name: str, chunk_size: int = -1)`
Reads the content of a file in chunks.

##### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `file_name` | str | The name of the file to read. |
| `chunk_size` | int | The size of each chunk to read. Defaults to -1, which reads the entire file at once.

##### Returns

`Generator[str, None, None]`: A generator yielding file content in chunks.

#### List all files
`list_all_files(self)`
Lists all files with extensions (.txt, .png, .pdf, etc) in the base directory and its subdirectories.

##### Returns

`list[File]`: A list of File objects representing the files with extensions in the directory.

#### Delete file
`delete_file(self, file_name: str)`
Deletes a specified file

##### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `file_name` | str | The name of the file to be deleted |

:::warning

Be careful, deleted files cannot be recovered.

:::

#### Get absolute path
`get_absolute_path(self, relative_path: str)`
Returns the absolute path of the file matching the relative path pattern

##### Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| relative_path | str | The relative path pattern. It should follow the rules used by the Unix shell. |

##### Returns

`str`: The absolute path of the matching file, or `None` if no match is found.
