# Music Generation

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps of setting up and using an AI Music Generation workflow using **Lunar**. At the end of this guide, you will find a video demonstration as well as instructions for setting up **Suno**, **Kits.ai**, and **Reaper** to start generating your own music.

## AI Music Generation Workflow Overview

The **AI Music Generation Workflow** leverages advanced generative AI technologies to create music. You can download and experiment with this workflow yourself.
