# LLM Prompt Component

## Overview
The **LLM Prompt** component connects to a Language Learning Model's (LLM) API, processes natural language prompts, and outputs the result as text. This component is designed to facilitate the interaction with an LLM, enabling users to send prompts and receive answers seamlessly.

## Features
- Connects to an LLM's API.
- Processes natural language prompts.
- Outputs the LLM's response as text.

## Inputs
- **Prompt (TEMPLATE)**: The natural language prompt that you want to send to the LLM. This should be a well-formed prompt that the LLM can understand and respond to accurately.

## Output
- **Output (TEXT)**: The response provided by the LLM to the given prompt. This is the text output generated by the LLM based on the input prompt.

## Configuration Parameters
- **ai_model_config**: Configuration settings for the AI model. These settings may include parameters like the model type, API keys, endpoint URLs, and other necessary configurations for connecting and interacting with the LLM's API.

## Usage
To use the LLM Prompt component, you need to provide a natural language prompt and ensure that the necessary configurations for the AI model are set. Once the prompt is sent, the component will connect to the LLM's API, process the prompt, and return the generated text response.

## Example
Here is a conceptual outline of how to configure and use the LLM Prompt component:

1. **Configure the AI Model**: Set up the `ai_model_config` with the necessary details such as model type, API keys, and endpoint URLs.

2. **Provide a Prompt**: Input a well-formed natural language prompt that you want the LLM to process.

3. **Get the Response**: The component will output the LLM's response as text.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the LLM Prompt component to interact with the Language Learning Model and obtain desired responses to your natural language prompts.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `ai_model_config` is correctly set up to avoid connection issues with the LLM's API.
- The quality and relevance of the LLM's response depend on the clarity and construction of the input prompt.
