# My First Workflow

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of manually creating a workflow in Lunar. By following the steps below, you will learn how to compose, run, and save workflows. At the end of this guide, you will find a video that demonstrates each step.

<!-- To learn how to create workflows using the co-pilot feature instead, visit the [Workflow Co-piloting](copilot.md) page. -->

## Steps to Manually Create a Workflow

### 1. **Create an Empty Workflow**
   - From either the **Home** or **Workflows** page, click the `Create workflow` button. This action opens the workflow editor with an empty canvas where you can start building your workflow.

### 2. **Compose Your Workflow with Components**
   - Browse through the different component groups on the left panel to find the components you need.
   - Click and drag the desired component from the library into the workflow editor.
   - To connect the components, drag from the small circles next to the input/output areas of the components to establish the workflow’s logic.
   - If a component’s output is only part of another component's input, you can use template variables. Below is an example showing how the *Azure Open AI prompt* component utilizes a template variable called *file_content*.

### 3. **Run the Workflow**
   - Once your workflow is composed, click the `Run` button in the upper right corner of the editor to execute the workflow and see the results.

### 4. **Save the Workflow**
   - After running the workflow, click the `Save` button in the upper right to preserve your work.
   - Provide a meaningful title and description, then click `Save` to store the workflow for future use.
